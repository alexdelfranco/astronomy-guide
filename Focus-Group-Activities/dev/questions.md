1. Stars are constantly emitting heat and light. Where do they get all this energy?

- If possible, describe the processes inside the star which are taking place.
- How much energy is released in each reaction? How many reactions are taking place every second?


2. Do bigger or smaller stars live longer? Describe why.

- Sketch a graph of a star's lifetime versus it's mass (with mass on the x-axis and lifetime on the y-axis).
- What range of stellar lifetimes do we observe (condider stars with masses from 1M to 100M)

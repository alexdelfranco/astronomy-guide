## Pre Questions

- How long does it take for a photon (light) to travel from the Sun to the Earth?
- Photons are made in the Sun’s core. How long should it take for a photon to escape the Sun?
- If we measure the time it takes a photon to travel out of the Sun, do you think it would be a shorter or longer time than your answer for #2? By how much? Justify your answer?
    - Answer alone, discuss in groups
- The radius of the Sun is proportional to its Mass ??(squared)??. If the Sun’s mass increased by a factor of 10, how much longer would it take for a photon to escape (move from core to edge)
- What properties do you expect to affect the escape time?

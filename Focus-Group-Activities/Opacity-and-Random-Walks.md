# Opacity and Random Walks

**Definition: **

## Background

Stars are hot balls of gas and light held together by gravity. At the core, light elements such as hydrogen and helium are fused to create heavier atoms. This fusion releases an enormous amount of energy that is eventually radiated away by photons leaving the edges of the star.

While this may seem straightforward enough, the mechanisms that tell us how the photons move from the center of the star to the edge can actually get pretty complex. The first thing to understand is that photons can't move in a straight path from the center of a star to its edge â€” there are many trillions of gas particles in its way. Instead, the photon makes quick jumps, bouncing between gas particles like a pinball in an arcade machine.

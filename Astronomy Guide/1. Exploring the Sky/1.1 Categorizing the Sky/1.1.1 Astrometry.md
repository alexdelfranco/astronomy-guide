#### Definition: 

## Background

Telescopes changed how we understand the sky. Before telescopes, stars were located by eye and their locations were documented in star charts. These charts took many forms, from large scrolls to tightly bound books. They were very delicate and usually very expensive.

Once telescopes were invented, we realized there were so many more stars in the sky than we ever could have imagined. Astronomers began keeping even more detailed charts and books. Many of these are still in use today!

## Questions

- Do we have names for all the stars?
- How do we locate a star in the sky?

## Takeaway

The answer to the first question is yes!

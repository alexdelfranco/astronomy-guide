# Astrometry

#### Definition: 

## Background

Telescopes changed how we understand the sky. Before telescopes, stars were located by eye and their locations were documented in star charts. These charts took many forms, from large scrolls to tightly bound books. They were very delicate and usually very expensive.

Once telescopes were invented, we realized there were so many more stars in the sky than we ever could have imagined. Astronomers began keeping even more detailed charts and books. Many of these are still in use today!

## Questions

- There are so many stars! Do we have names for all of them?
- How do we locate a star in the sky? Once we find it, how do we write down its location?

## Takeaway

It turns out we do have names for all the stars we can see. For centuries, astronomers have been naming and organizing stars in the sky. Around 100 years ago, an intrepid group of women observed, catalogued, and analyzed hundreds of thousands of stars. Known as the Harvard Astronomers, they are responsible for documenting many of the stars we speak about today. We will talk about many of them later in this course!

**Catalogs**: Lists of stars are called catalogs. Along with the names of thousands of stars, catalogs will include other facts about a star, such as its location, brightness, and age. You can access dozens of catalogs online for free! [Simbad](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basicIdent=m33&submit=SIMBAD+search), for example, is a free, online database where you can explore all sorts of astronomical objects far outside of our solar system. We will explore Simbad later in this course!

So how do we locate stars in the sky? Astronomers developed a system of coordinates for the sky similar to longitude and lattitude on Earth. The two coordinates are called *Right Ascension* and *Declination*, commonly abbreviated as RA and Dec. With a value for RA and a value for Dec, you can locate any object on the entire sky!

Astronomers used to use long printed out catalogs to organize all the stars. Now, computers have made that job much easier.

## Activity

In this activity, you will take this real image of the sky, find its RA and Dec (its sky coordinates), and use those values to find the names and brightnesses of all the stars in the image! To accomplish this, we will introduce a couple of free tools used by professional astrophysisists that will be very useful later in the course.

Here is an image of a large cluster of stars in deep space. It was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007. Let's figure out where in the sky it is located and how many stars are actually in this cluster!

Begin by opening a new tab in your favorite browser and heading to [https://nova.astrometry.net](https://nova.astrometry.net). This website is incredibly powerful: it can find the location of any image within minutes. Once you arrive at the home page, you can explore recent images uploaded by real scientists by clicking the large *Explore* button. For this activity, we want to upload our own image, so we want to instead click the *Calibrate & Share* pane right below.

Since this image is already online, select the *url* option and paste the following url: [https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/screen/heic1509a.jpg](https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/screen/heic1509a.jpg) which links directly to the image. Once the url is pasted in, click *Upload*. You should be redirected to a page that will automatically refresh every 10 seconds while it analyzes your image. The processing should take about 10 minutes.

While we wait for the image to process, lets examine it a bit more closely. Here are some questions to guide your thoughts:

- Why do the stars appear as plus signs? Are the plus signs real parts of the stars or are they caused by something else?
- What colors do you see in the image? Which parts have which colors?
- What color stars do you see in the image? Are there more stars of one color compared to another?

Answers: It turns out that the plus signs are caused by the type of telescope that took the picture. The Hubble Telescope orbits the Earth and has been taking images of space since the 1990s. Because of how the camera was built, close and bright stars have a characteristic x-shaped pattern that shows up. All stars are in fact spherical in shape. We will leave the answers to the other two questions for later in this course. Color is actually one of the best ways we can learn about space, so we need to save it for a full future chapter.

Once you have spent a few minutes answering the above questions, check back on your *astrometry.net* tab. Once the image is processed, you should see *"Success"* written in bright green in the middle of the page next to a small version of your image. Right above *"Success"*, click on the link titled *"Go to results page"*. You should see your image with some green text on top of it and to the right you should see values for its RA and Dec. You found the star cluster!
